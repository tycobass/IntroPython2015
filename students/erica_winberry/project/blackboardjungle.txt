GymnasiumThe gymnasium is where the Parsely Greens have their home games. It’s currently empty of sweaty athletes and cheering fans. You smell a locker room to the east. You see someone’s eyeglasses case laying on the groundExits: East, NorthNotes:Examine Case: inside the case are a pair of ladies eyeglasses.Examine glasses: The horn-rimmed glasses aren’t really your style.Wearing the glasses blurs the player’s vision, making it difficult to look or examine.Locker RoomYou are in one of the Parsely High’s locker rooms. There is a janitor’s cart here.Exits: WestNotes:Examine Cart: The janitor’s cart is more of less a trash can on wheels. A bucket of pink sawdust and a broom hang from the cart.The player can push the cart around or take the individual items.Examine Trash: The trash can contains: a freshmanIf the player doesn’t search the trash can, have the freshman plead for help if the cart is pushed into the northern hallway.Talk freshman: Are you serious? Someone might see youIf taken or released from the trash can, the freshman runs off crying.Hallway (south)You stand at the south end of a long hallway, flanked by metal lockers. Someone appears to have had tummy troubles; a puddle of sick lies in the middle of the corridor.Exits: south, northNotes:Examine lockers: Your locker isn’t here.Examine puddle: The puddle is…kinda gross.  It was Salisbury Steak Day.If the player goes north without cleaning up the puddle, he slips and falls, bumping his head. Then he wakes up in the Nurse’s Office.Putting pink sawdust down on the puddle solves the problem.If the player also sweeps up the sawdust, just say, “You’ll make a fine janitor some day.”Nurse’s OfficeYou wake up in the nurse’s office with a terrible headache and blurry vision. The school nurse decides you should go to the hospital for an MRI, just in case. The End.Hallway (north)You are standing at the northern end of a long hallway. Your locker is here. You see the door leading to your English class.Exits: east, south, northNotes:Examine locker: It’s your locker, you think. It’s been a while since you’ve opened it.Open locker: You can’t remember your combination! You know you wrote it down somewhere…Examine door: You see Mr. Bushel giving a lecture on last night’s homework. Oops.Use combination 16-32-64: Uh oh.  The numbers on the lock don’t go that high.Examine lock: The lock is your basic, tempered steel, 32-digit combination lock. Very hard to pick! (You’ve tried.)Use combination 8-16-32: The locker opens. Inside you see your English paper.Examine English paper: You paid good money for this!LibraryYou’re in the library, where you usually spend your after-school time in detention. There is a study cubby here. There is a book here.  The school librarian is here.Exits: southNotes:Examine librarian: The librarian squints at you. “Where are you supposed to be [young lady/young man]? (The librarian confuses the player’s gender without her glasses.)Examine book: The books’ title is Cryptography for Dummies.  You remember skimming it during detention yesterday but that was a long time ago.Read book: “Divide by 2” is scrawled in the margin of the book in your handwriting.Examine cubby: The wooden desk has a series of numbers scratched into it: 16-32-64.Talk librarian: “Shhh!” – The librarian will not talk to the player.Returning the eyeglasses gives the player a “Get out of detention free” card (not literally.)ClassroomYou step into the classroom and your teacher, Mr. Bushel, clears his throat. “You’re late, as usual. I sincerely hope you remembered your homework.” He holds out his hand expectantly.Exits: westNotes:Turning in the English paper to Mr. Bushel wins the game.Not turning in the homework assignment results in Mr. Bushel sending the players to the library for detention. The player may not duck out of the room—doing this will also result in an immediate trip to the library for detention.If the player has the eyeglasses, the librarian allows the player to leave detention. “Oh, thank you so much for these, [young lady/young man] (correct gender)! I can’t see a thing without them!”If not…You spend the next four hours staring at the wall. The end.Credits:Blackboard Jungle, a Parsely Microgreen (version 1.2)Parsely created by: Jared A.
