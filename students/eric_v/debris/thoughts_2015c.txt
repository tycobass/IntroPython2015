May the force be with you!

While loons have infiltrated our political process and public anxiety regarding recent local and overseas events has begun to rise it is time
for a diversion of galactic proportions.   A grand cinematic illusion of romance and action set in a galaxy far far away.  In a year filled
with toy drones and exploding hoverboards, Kathy, Eric, and family have had another fascinating?? year.

Sis (12)

Curteousy of a recent growth spurt Sissy began the year by finally being able to reach the rear hatch of the van.  
At first she would need a running jump, then just a leap, and now on the tip of her toes she can calmly reach up
and then shut the hatch.  Kidnap! - Our new extremely friendly rescue dog, Blue, licked all of the hair off of Sissy's 
???? American Girl doll.  Kathy scheduled time at the American Girl hospital using the official admission form. Kathy and Sis 
then packed ???? in a comfortable med-evac transportation pod (box), and shipped her off the the hospital where 
somewhere during the journey, she vanished without a trace.  Sissy fretted for weeks awaiting word of ????'s status or demise.
Suddenly, after concern over ????? unfortunate demise had begun to wane, ?????'s appeared on our doorstep in a new transportation pod
with a sincere apology from the hospital for the mixup and delay.  Her hair had completely re-grown and appeared just like new.

Peach pit seeds - Edward and then Emily.



Christian

In all families and households there are little events that signal transitions like passing a certain milepost on a familiar 
roadtrip. Not one to shy away from sibling competition Christian had his own growth spurt.  As he came bounding down the
stairs one early morning he hit his head on the doorway at the bottom of the stairs knocking him ass over teakettle landing him
in a grumbling pile in the hallway.  A sudden and stern communique that gowing older brings both unbounded opportunities
as well as risks and responsiblities.  Fortunately, the headache associated with Christian's encounter with the stairway door was
shortlived, because he recieved a full drum set from his uncle Paul as a ????? present.  Christian, who is attending Roosevelt
this year also faced another conflict playing both on the freshman football team and also in the school band.

Eric
Eric discarding Windows 2000 and 286/386 slot1 processor linus machine
Eric perl class - hashes, sparse arrays, parsers, might well be out of Dr. Who
As Eric's employer has announced it is relocating several major programs to the Midwest as it 
scrambles to leave liberal Seattle, the unions and it's aging workforce behind.
Sharpening the skills.
First a year of perl training from Cal State Fullerton and now another year of Python training 
from University of Washington.
If the trip gets too arduouse, Eric can partake in a pastry and a warm beverage of his choosing 
before opening his mind to three hours of intense hands on training in Python.
New stainless steel coffee maker at work.
It seems to be a requirement of the human condition that folks have worries that seem big to them 
and small to others.  Eric encountered such a concern when Apple pushed out IOS 9 and it wrecked
the text messaging on his old reliable Iphone 4.  Hardest was dumping Siri who had been with him through 
thick and think.  Unceremoniously kicked to the curb.
May you want everything you get for Christmas.

Blue - sits attentively, throw a treat, watches it intently and then blinks as it hits his nose.
It then falls to the floor, he steps on it so that he can't see it and then frantically searches 
while attempting to keep Skagit from snatching it off the floor.
He can now catch it if there are no distractions.

By the time Kathy got in to the room she found Blue licking the cat.

Now they have reached a point where Blue sniffs Ziggy and he makes a tail twitch.
